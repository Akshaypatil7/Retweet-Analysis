# Winner of Retweet-Analysis Competition
Group Id:1951
### Retweets Analysis (NLP and Social Media Analytics) (Competition ID: AC06)
-  This project will involve picking tweets in any topic (like sports, entertainment etc.) and retweet it so as to get maximum influence score (likes+comments+retweets). Create an algorithm that can learn from publicly available data and assign a score to any tweet based on its content and attributes. You may also create a repository of tweets based on your topic of interest and retweet them to find out the scores.

-  Evaluation Criteria: on the date of evaluation (19th July) you’ll need to retweet 24 items on your topic from a handle created on or after 12th June. The total influence score attained by all these tweets together will be your score for the competition.

-  What you’ll learn: Application of NLP. How to build a basic model first and then improve it using different other features. We will also see how deep neural networks can be used and some ideas about ensembling in general.

-  Prize money: 4k per member (excluding learning members)
